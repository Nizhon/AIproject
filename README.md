# AIproject
A solo student project that was done over the course of four weeks.
For this project, we ourselves decided what we wanted to get better 
at/specialize in and I chose AI, Pathfinding, and modularity by 
creating an ECS that holds all the different AIs/Entities I would 
create and their respective components.

These gitfiles are for VIEWING only.
